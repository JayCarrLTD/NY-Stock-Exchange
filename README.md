# NY Stock Exchange
 
## INTRODUCTION
In this project we will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. You will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. We have created a smaller subset of the data that you will be using for the project.

## QUESTION 


## UNDERSTAND

Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list. Your drop-down list should pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement. The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.

Create a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) of your choice that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case). Your assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin should change for each scenario.
